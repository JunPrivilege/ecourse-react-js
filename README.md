# How To Use Code Snapshots
Code snapshots are primarily provided to allow you to compare your code to mine. The snapshots are taken directly 
from the course recordings and therefore reflect my code you see in the videos.

Of course, you can also try running those code snapshots on your machine. You'll need to run `npm install` in the 
individual snapshot folders, followed by `npm run dev` to start the development server - just as shown in the course.
